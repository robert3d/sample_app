# README - SAMPLE_APP

## This is the sample_app project from the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) by Micheal Hartl.

If you are learning Rails, I would highly recommend this tutorial, as it is the best introduction to Test Driven Development using RSpec and Cucumber that I have come across so far.

You may noticed in the gemfile that I used Ruby 2.1.0 and created a project specific gemfile (#ruby-gemset=railstutorial_rails_4_0), but other than that I stayed true to the tutorial's directions.

If you are using RVM, you can create project specific gemsets by using the following command: "rvm use ruby-VERSION_NUMBER@GEMSET_NAME", for example, I used: "rvm use ruby-2.1.0@railstutorial_rails_4_0" (Without quotes). Visit the [RVM.io](http://rvm.io/gemsets) for more info.
